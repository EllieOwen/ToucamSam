Exploring the use of Raspberry Pi Cameras Module for depth perception and motion tracking.
This project is starting with a pair of RPi camera modules (part No. 913-2664).

I have available a RPi3B, RPi2B+, and RPi ZeroW to use.  Each camera will be attached to it's own RPi.
I will begin with using the picamera and opencv liberaries and see where it leads me.
I'll set up the RPi headless and it would be possible to access it remotely may anyone with the proper username and password.
